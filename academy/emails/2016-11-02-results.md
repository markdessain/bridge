Hello Everyone,

#### Holland Park Bridge Group Results

Thank you to everyone who attended our first game at _Walmer Caster_. We had a great turn out and the feeling in the room was overwhelming positive. A good amount of space but more importantly been able to hear each other at the table stood out which made the evening a success. I'm looking forward to welcoming more of you back there next week.

One point I would like to quickly make is can everyone remember to count how many cards they have at the start of the hand. From time to time cards can end up in the wrong place but it can be fixed if we spot it before starting the board, as usual just call me over.

The results for _2nd November 2016 - Gentle Duplicate_ are as follows:

|Players                         | Score  | 	
|--------------------------------|--------|
|Chris Tolley & Ruth Saunders|63.33%|
|John Currier & Jill Lincoln|55.00%|
|Fadi Hayek & Mark Dessain|50.00%|
|Caroline Bottoms & Sasha Chamberlain|46.67%|
|Gita Roy & Lynne Maxwell|43.33%|
|Maureen Burke & Ari Glover|41.67%|

The full results along with hand records can be found on the [ruffclub website](http://www.bridgewebs.com/cgi-bin/bwoi/bw.cgi?pid=display_rank&event=20161102_1&club=ruffclub).

If there were any boards which you think were particularly interesting or challenging which you would like to discuss please let me know. Hope to see you again soon.

Regards,

Mark Dessain
