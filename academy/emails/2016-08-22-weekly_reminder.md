Hello Everyone,

#### Holland Park / Academy Bridge Group

Just a quick reminder about the bridge this Wednesday at _Castle Holland Park_. As usual it will continue to be a gentle duplicate where everyone is welcome and I will be available throughout to answer any bridge related questions.

Please feel free to attend even if you do not have a partner, we will make sure to pair you up with another player before we start.

We will aim to play about 16 boards and there should be roughly three to five tables.

We will be using BriAn Bridge to keep a record of the scores. It would be really useful if players who have mobile phones could download the app - [ios](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/free-brian-bridge-client/id576769349?mt=8) / [android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=freebrian.com&hl=en_GB).

Please do contact me if you have any questions.

Regards,

Mark Dessain
