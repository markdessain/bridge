Hello Everyone,

####  Walmer Castle Bridge Group Reminder

This week I have not been able to arrange cover for the session and I am unable to make it. Upstairs has also been booked out so this week we will have space reserved in the snug room (on the way up the stairs).

I have left a full set of 18 boards in the box along side the rest of the usual equipment. As before we still have space booked for us so everyone is still welcome to play.

The scores will be recorded using BriAn Bridge and it would be really useful if players who have mobile phones could download the app - [ios](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/free-brian-bridge-client/id576769349?mt=8) / [android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=freebrian.com&hl=en_GB).
