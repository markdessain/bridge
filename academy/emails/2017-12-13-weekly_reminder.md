Hello Everyone,

Following on from my last email, I'd like to confirm that bridge will be on this evening (13th) and next week (20th). These will be the two final sessions of 2017 and we will then resume in January next year.

Victor Lesk will be taking over this evening and then I will be back next week. If I don't get a chance to see you I hope you have a great Christmas and New Year.

####  Walmer Castle Bridge Group Reminder

Just a quick reminder about the bridge this _Wednesday_ at _The Walmer Castle_. As usual it will continue to be a gentle duplicate where everyone is welcome and I will be available throughout the evening to answer any bridge related questions.

Please feel free to attend even if you do not have a partner, we will make sure to pair you up with another player before we start.
