Hello Everyone,

####  Walmer Castle Bridge Group Cancelled

Please be aware that there will be no Bridge at the Walmer Castle this week, this is due to the [Crouch End Cafe Bridge](https://www.brianbridge.net/crouchend2018/) taking place on the same day. 

We will be back on as Usual for following week on Wednesday 23rd May.

Please do contact me if you have any questions.

Regards,

Mark Dessain
