Hello Everyone,

#### {name} Bridge Group

Just a reminder about the bridge this {day} at _{venue}_. As usual it will continue to be a gentle duplicate game. I will be avalible throughout to answer any questions if you get stuck.

We will play about 16 boards and there should be roughly three to five tables.

Please feel free to attend even if you do not have a partner, we will pair you up with another player before we start.

We will be using BriAn Bridge to keep a record of the scores. It would be really useful if players who have mobile phones could download the app - [ios](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/free-brian-bridge-client/id576769349?mt=8) / [android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=freebrian.com&hl=en_GB).
